# Insect Species Recognition using PVT

This project focuses on classifying insect species using the **Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT)** model implemented in PyTorch.

## Project Highlights
- Recognizes multiple insect species from images
- Uses PVT-V2-B0 model from the `timm` library
- Includes training, evaluation, and inference scripts
- Calculates per-class accuracy and overall performance
